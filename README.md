[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/JamieMason/shrinkpack](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/JamieMason/shrinkpack?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Shrinkpack complements the [npm shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap) command by maintaining a `node_shrinkwrap` directory in your project, containing the exact same tarballs that `npm install` downloads from [https://registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org).

The rest of the `npm install` process is exactly the same. The only difference is that no network activity is necessary when installing and building your project. The `node_shrinkwrap` directory can be ignored in your editor (much like is done with the `node_modules` directory) but is instead checked into source control.

## Installation

```
npm install --global shrinkpack
```

## Usage

> For context, please see the [target problem](#target-problem) and [justification](#justification) sections of this README.

Whenever we add, remove, or update an npm dependency — we should test our application for regressions before locking down our dependencies to avoid them mutating over time.

Managing an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file can be done as follows;

```shell
# generate an up-to-date npm-shrinkwrap.json (--dev includes devDependencies)
npm shrinkwrap --dev

# update node_shrinkwrap and localise npm-shrinkwrap.json
shrinkpack
```

You can also optionally choose to run `npm prune` and `npm dedupe` beforehand, to ensure `node_modules` is optimised.

## Target Problem

On most projects I've worked on we've had a [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) (or similiar) continuous integration environment, where we would run tests, analyse code, gather metrics, and create deployment packages.

Each time code was pushed to our `develop` and `master` branches, a repeatable process was carried out where a clean workspace is created, the latest version of the project is installed and configured, before testing and code analysis take place.

We were all very happy with this process and the convenience of npm in particular, but the phase of our builds where `npm install` listed a huge amount of network traffic would always raise the same concerns;

+ This seems slow, wasteful, and inefficient.
+ We _really_ depend on registry.npmjs.org, what do we do if it goes down?

The first suggestion was always to check in our dependencies, but the idea of some large and chatty commits whenever we chose to upgrade or change them would put us off. 

Some teams went a little further and decided that pain was acceptable and decided to proceed, only to find that some packages such as [phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs) helpfully install the appropriate binary for you depending on what system you're running. 

This meant that if Chris added phantomjs to the project on his Mac and checked it into the repository, Helen wouldn't be able to use it on her Windows Machine. The remaining alternatives were proxies, mirrors, and caches-of-sorts. 

None of these approaches appealed to us and, grudgingly, we continued as we were (<abbr title="Your Mileage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>).

## Justification

### npm shrinkwrap

`npm shrinkwrap` is something I would recommend you use anyway, even if you don't decide to use `shrinkpack`. It brings certainty and confidence over exactly what versions of every nested dependency you've tested against and approved.

A tagged release should be a locked-down, fixed point in time which has been tested sufficiently enough that it is approved and trusted. When fed into a repeatable, automated deployment process it should always result in the same output.

Without `npm shrinkwrap` that's not guaranteed. 

Consider this snippet from the `package.json` of a nested dependency in your project as an example;

```json
"dependencies": {
    "lolwut": ">=0.1.0"
}
```

If `lolwut@0.2.4` contains a regression and you're not using `npm shrinkwrap` then [congratulations](http://m.memegen.com/8ky0s4.jpg), your project now contains a regression.

### shrinkpack

With you hopefully convinced of the merits of `npm shrinkwrap`, `shrinkpack` will hopefully be seen as a small and complementary addition.

`shrinkpack` hopes to take `npm shrinkwrap` a little further by taking the .tgz tarballs of that specific, shrinkwrapped dependency graph saved by `npm shrinkwrap` and  stores them within your project.

This means;

+ No need for repeated requests to registry.npmjs.org.
+ Each package/version pair can be checked in as a single tarball, avoiding commits with all kinds of noisy diffs.
+ Packages can be checked in, while still installed by members of the team on different operating systems.
+ Complements the typical `npm shrinkwrap` workflow.

## Workflow Example

### Standard Flow

Carina has a project called my-project with the following `package.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "chalk": "0.5.1",
    "lodash": "3.2.0"
  }
}
```

and the following `.gitignore`.

```
npm-debug.log
node_modules
```

Having just cloned this repository, she runs `npm install --loglevel=http`.

```
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/chalk
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/chalk
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/has-ansi
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/escape-string-regexp
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/ansi-styles
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/strip-ansi
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/supports-color
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/has-ansi
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/escape-string-regexp
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/ansi-styles
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/strip-ansi
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/supports-color
npm http request GET https://registry.npmjs.org/ansi-regex
npm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/ansi-regex
chalk@0.5.1 node_modules/chalk
├── escape-string-regexp@1.0.2
├── ansi-styles@1.1.0
├── supports-color@0.2.0
├── has-ansi@0.1.0 (ansi-regex@0.2.1)
└── strip-ansi@0.3.0 (ansi-regex@0.2.1)

lodash@3.2.0 node_modules/lodash
```

This is typical behaviour, npm downloads the packages from the registry and installs them, leaving the following directory structure;

```
├── .gitignore
├── node_modules
│   ├── (lots of files and folders)
└── package.json
```

Next Carina runs `npm shrinkwrap --dev` from the my-project directory.

```
$ npm shrinkwrap --dev
wrote npm-shrinkwrap.json
```

Then she runs `shrinkpack`.

```
$ shrinkpack
+ chalk@0.5.1
+ ansi-styles@1.1.0
+ escape-string-regexp@1.0.3
+ ansi-regex@0.2.1
+ lodash@3.2.0
+ has-ansi@0.1.0
+ supports-color@0.2.0
+ strip-ansi@0.3.0
shrinkpack +8 -0
```

Leaving the following directory structure.

```
├── .gitignore
├── node_modules
│   ├── (lots of files and folders)
├── node_shrinkwrap
│   ├── ansi-regex-0.2.1.tgz
│   ├── ansi-styles-1.1.0.tgz
│   ├── chalk-0.5.1.tgz
│   ├── escape-string-regexp-1.0.2.tgz
│   ├── has-ansi-0.1.0.tgz
│   ├── lodash-3.2.0.tgz
│   ├── strip-ansi-0.3.0.tgz
│   └── supports-color-0.2.0.tgz
├── npm-shrinkwrap.json
└── package.json
```

`npm-shrinkwrap.json` has also been updated so that each `resolved` property points to the checked-in packages in the `node_shrinkwrap` directory.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "chalk": {
      "version": "0.5.1",
      "from": "chalk@>=0.5.1 <0.6.0",
      "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/chalk-0.5.1.tgz",
      "dependencies": {
        "ansi-styles": {
          "version": "1.1.0",
          "from": "ansi-styles@>=1.1.0 <2.0.0",
          "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/ansi-styles-1.1.0.tgz"
        },
        "escape-string-regexp": {
          "version": "1.0.2",
          "from": "escape-string-regexp@>=1.0.0 <2.0.0",
          "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/escape-string-regexp-1.0.2.tgz"
        },
        "has-ansi": {
          "version": "0.1.0",
          "from": "has-ansi@>=0.1.0 <0.2.0",
          "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/has-ansi-0.1.0.tgz",
          "dependencies": {
            "ansi-regex": {
              "version": "0.2.1",
              "from": "ansi-regex@>=0.2.0 <0.3.0",
              "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/ansi-regex-0.2.1.tgz"
            }
          }
        },
        "strip-ansi": {
          "version": "0.3.0",
          "from": "strip-ansi@>=0.3.0 <0.4.0",
          "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/strip-ansi-0.3.0.tgz",
          "dependencies": {
            "ansi-regex": {
              "version": "0.2.1",
              "from": "ansi-regex@>=0.2.0 <0.3.0",
              "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/ansi-regex-0.2.1.tgz"
            }
          }
        },
        "supports-color": {
          "version": "0.2.0",
          "from": "supports-color@>=0.2.0 <0.3.0",
          "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/supports-color-0.2.0.tgz"
        }
      }
    },
    "lodash": {
      "version": "3.2.0",
      "from": "lodash@>=3.2.0 <4.0.0",
      "resolved": "node_shrinkwrap/lodash-3.2.0.tgz"
    }
  }
}
```

Carina checks this code into Git and tells her co-worker Clive that it's ready for him to contribute to.

Having just cloned this repository, he runs `npm install --loglevel=http`.

```
chalk@0.5.1 node_modules/chalk
├── escape-string-regexp@1.0.2
├── ansi-styles@1.1.0
├── supports-color@0.2.0
├── strip-ansi@0.3.0 (ansi-regex@0.2.1)
└── has-ansi@0.1.0 (ansi-regex@0.2.1)

lodash@3.2.0 node_modules/lodash
```

This is new behaviour, npm didn't hit the network at all. Instead it read the packages from the `node_shrinkwrap` directory directly and installed them straight away.

```
├── .gitignore
├── node_modules
│   ├── (lots of files and folders)
├── node_shrinkwrap
│   ├── ansi-regex-0.2.1.tgz
│   ├── ansi-styles-1.1.0.tgz
│   ├── chalk-0.5.1.tgz
│   ├── escape-string-regexp-1.0.2.tgz
│   ├── has-ansi-0.1.0.tgz
│   ├── lodash-3.2.0.tgz
│   ├── strip-ansi-0.3.0.tgz
│   └── supports-color-0.2.0.tgz
├── npm-shrinkwrap.json
└── package.json
```

### Changing and removing dependencies

Simply edit your `package.json` and re-run `npm shrinkwrap` followed by `shrinkpack`.
