FEATURE REQUESTS
================

Adding features is fun, but a good feature request must consider;

+ What the problem being faced is.
+ What % of users you expect probably encounter this problem.
+ If the feature didn't exist, what alternatives or workarounds might exist to deliver the same result.
+ Why shrinkpack is proper place for this functionality to live.
+ The task(s) people carry out and where shrinkpack and the new feature would fit into that workflow.
+ What other tools, new or existing, that might be more appropriate for taking on responsibility for delivering this feature.

BUG REPORTS
===========

Before raising a bug, try to determine whether your issue is introduced by using shrinkpack. By that I mean, could this bug happen if you were just using `npm shrinkwrap` on it's own?

A good bug report tends to contain (in order of usefulness);

+ Expected behaviour.
+ Actual behaviour.
+ List of terminal commands to reproduce the bug.
+ Copies of any important log or error output.
+ Operating system and version.
+ Node.js version.
+ npm version.
+ Shrinkpack version.
+ Contents of npm-shrinkwrap.json.
+ Contents of package.json.
